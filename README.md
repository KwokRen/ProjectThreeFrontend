### Description

***

Deciding you want to be pursue a career in software engineer? Not sure where to start? DeveloperToob is the perfect place for you to begin your journey! DeveloperToob is a free web application that allows users to watch Youtube videos specifically geared towards programming and web development.

All users can browse through the videos freely, or they can choose to register an account on our website. All users can then select videos of their choices and then it will open up a video player. The video player will include the title, a like and dislike feature, and the comments section. Unregistered users can view comments and watch the video, but registered users will have access to adding comments, and using the like and dislike feature. This application is also mobile friendly!

The frontend is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue. We also used the BootStrap library and FontAwesome to choose a variety of icons. It is deployed through Netlify.

### Inspirational Designs

***

Link To Site  | One Thing I'd Like To Incorporate | Initial Research On That Item
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [https://youtube.com/](https://youtube.com/)| The whole site was an inspiration to take from. We saw how all the videos displayed on the homepage, and wanted to do the same thing. They also had a navigation bar. The video player page they take us to have a comments section that we wanted to reiterate. They also had a like and dislike feature. | We liked the design of Youtube, so we wanted a list of videos on our homepage. The comments section required users to be logged in, so we also made sure that users were logged in to comment, as well as using the likes and dislikes feature. |
