## DeveloperToob

A place where developers can have active conversations about content surrounding software development!

* This site will have active chat features as well as video playback and user login. 

* This website is made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the frontend. The backend is made with Ruby on Rails, sqlite, and Postgres to create API's.

* The backend will be deployed on Heroku, while the frontend will be deployed on netlify. 

* Combining all these functionalities will allow us to create a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application.
